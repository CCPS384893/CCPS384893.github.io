      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I'm working toward becoming a physical therapist that earned their degree at the University of Florida. I hope to have a healthy family, with a good and stable life in the future. I can't recall any experiences that led me here, I just know I've wanted to be what I called a "bone doctor" ever since I was around five. Ways I'm working toward these goals are maintaining responsibility and independence, these will help with keeping track of things like schedules and working hard to figure things out on your own instead of relying on others. I maintain good grades with no missing assignments and good test scores, this will continue to improve my gpa and increase my chances of getting into UF. These achievements will help me reach my goals, and they will make me proud. Values I consider most necessary and important include the values I said above. Responsibility, independence, reliability, organization, trustworthy and respect. All of these are great personal traits and values to have, these will help you with almost anything. Short-term goals I hope to accomplish are academic and professional. For academics I want to accomplish straight a's, good test scores and a good reputation to teachers. While for professional I want to accomplish a label of a hard worker, continuing to be punctual and reliable. I have character traits I want to continue to be known for. These include pretty much everything I said above, responsibility, independence, reliability, organization, respect, hard working and trust. These traits and values will get you anywhere you want in life, and help you achieve anything.</p>
